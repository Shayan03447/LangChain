output Parser
output parser in langchain helps to convert raw llm output into structured format like in csv,pydantic models, json schema and more. they ensure consistency, validation, and ease of use in application
1st: String output parser
2nd:json output parser
3rd:structured output parser
4th: pydantic output parser

String output parser:
        simplest output parser in langchain. it is used to parse the output of a llm model into a plain string
Json output parser: 
        It force the llm they can pass their output in a json format 
structured output parser:
        structured output parser in langchain that helps extract structured json data from llm response based on predefined schema
        it works by defining a list of field that the model should return, ensure the output follows the structured format 
        we can enforce the schema in structured output Parser
        we can not validate the data
pydantic output parser:
        pydantic output parser is a structured output parser in langchain that uses pydantic model to enforce the validation schema when processing llm response
