Three ways to work for getting the response in structured
pydantic model 
     Default value : giving the Default value when we specify the variable
     optional field: optional is used when you dont know the llm has this information or not 
     Builtin validation
     field function -> Default value, discription, constraints, regex expression
     return pydantic object convert into json schema

Type dict
        Typedict is a way to define the dictionary in python where you specify what keys and values should exist. it helps to ensure that your dictionary follows a specific structure
        there is no validation in it 
        it only tells the python what keys are required and what type of  values they should have 
        it not validate the data it just tell and help with type hint for better coding
        [Annotated] it ensure that the type is strict 
json schema
